# RTV Risk Assessment Model

This project implements a machine learning system to identify households at risk of not achieving the $2/day income target. The system includes data processing, model training, prediction, and monitoring components.

## Overview

The RTV Risk Assessment Model uses a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a household is at risk (income < $2/day) or not at risk (income >= $2/day) based on various household characteristics including demographics, income sources, agricultural data, assets, and expenditure patterns.

## Components

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Data Processor** (`data_processor.py`): Handles data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering
2. **Model Trainer** (`model_trainer.py`): Trains and evaluates the risk assessment model
3. **Predictor** (`predictor.py`): Generates predictions using the trained model
4. **Model Monitor** (`monitor.py`): Monitors model performance and detects data drift
5. **MLOps Pipeline** (`ml_ops.py`): Orchestrates the entire workflow

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
```

### Directory Structure

Ensure the following directories exist (they will be created automatically if not):

```
models/     # For storing trained models
predictions/ # For storing prediction outputs
monitoring/ # For storing monitoring results
```

## Usage

### Data Processing

Process raw data for model training:

```bash
python data_processor.py --input_file interview_dataset.csv --output_file processed_data.csv
```

### Model Training

Train the risk assessment model:

```bash
python model_trainer.py --data_file interview_dataset.csv --output_dir models
```

This will:

- Process the data
- Train a Random Forest model
- Evaluate model performance
- Save the model to the specified output directory

### Generating Predictions

Generate predictions for new data:

```bash
python predictor.py --model_path models/rtv_risk_model_v20230101.joblib --input_file new_data.csv --output_file predictions/new_predictions.csv
```

### Model Monitoring

Monitor model performance and check for data drift:

```bash
python monitor.py --model_path models/rtv_risk_model_v20230101.joblib --reference_data models/reference_data_20230101.csv --new_data new_data.csv --monitoring_dir monitoring
```

### Running the Complete Pipeline

Run the entire MLOps pipeline with a single command:

```bash
python ml_ops.py --data_file interview_dataset.csv --output_dir models
```

With custom configuration:

```bash
python ml_ops.py --config config.json
```

## Configuration

You can customize the pipeline using a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "data_file": "interview_dataset.csv",
  "output_dir": "models",
  "predictions_dir": "predictions",
  "monitoring_dir": "monitoring",
  "reference_data_ratio": 0.3,
  "notification_email": "user@example.com",
  "retrain_frequency_days": 180
}
```

## Model Details

The risk assessment model:

- Uses a Random Forest classifier with 200 trees
- Classifies households as "at risk" (income < $2/day) or "not at risk" (income >= $2/day)
- Uses an optimized threshold to balance precision and recall
- Includes feature importance analysis to identify key risk factors

## Monitoring

The monitoring system checks for:

- Data drift: Detects if new data differs significantly from training data
- Performance degradation: Tracks model accuracy over time
- Model freshness: Alerts when the model needs retraining

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the log files (`mlops_pipeline.log`)
2. Ensure all required directories exist
3. Verify the data file format matches the expected schema
4. Check that the model path points to a valid model file
